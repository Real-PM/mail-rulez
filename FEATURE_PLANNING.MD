# Gmail-Specific Processing Feature Planning

## Problem Statement

Gmail uses labels/tags instead of traditional IMAP folders, which creates unique challenges for email processing systems designed around folder-based workflows. The current Mail-Rulez system has architectural issues when processing Gmail accounts:

### Current Issues

1. **Label Accumulation**: When processing training folders (e.g., `_Approved`), the training label remains on the message even after adding the destination label (`Processed`). This creates messages with multiple labels that could be reprocessed incorrectly.

2. **Pending Label Persistence**: Messages moved from `Pending` to other destinations retain the `Pending` label, potentially causing reprocessing loops or confusion.

3. **Training Workflow Confusion**: Gmail users see messages in multiple "folders" simultaneously, breaking the clean workflow expectations.

4. **Rule Application Issues**: Custom rules face the same problem - applying an action label doesn't remove the condition label.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### How Standard IMAP Works (Expected)
```
Inbox → Move to Pending → Move to Processed
[Message in Inbox] → [Message in Pending only] → [Message in Processed only]
```

### How Gmail Labels Work (Current Problem)
```
Inbox → Add Pending label → Add Processed label
[Message in Inbox] → [Message in Inbox+Pending] → [Message in Inbox+Pending+Processed]
```

### Code Investigation
- `process_inbox.py` lines 59-61: Uses `mb.move()` operations
- `functions.py` training folder processing: Uses `mb.move()` operations
- No explicit label cleanup or removal functionality found
- imap-tools library `move()` method behavior on Gmail needs verification

## Proposed Solution: Gmail-Aware Processing

### Feature: Gmail Label Management System

#### 1. Gmail Account Detection
```python
def is_gmail_account(account_email: str) -> bool:
    """Detect if account is Gmail-based"""
    gmail_domains = ['gmail.com', 'googlemail.com']
    return any(domain in account_email.lower() for domain in gmail_domains)
```

#### 2. Enhanced Move Operations for Gmail
```python
def gmail_aware_move(mailbox, message_uids, destination_folder, source_folder=None):
    """
    Gmail-specific move that properly handles label cleanup
    
    Args:
        mailbox: IMAP connection
        message_uids: List of message UIDs to move
        destination_folder: Target label/folder
        source_folder: Source label/folder to remove (optional)
    """
    if not message_uids:
        return
        
    # Add destination label
    mailbox.move(message_uids, destination_folder)
    
    # Remove source label if specified (Gmail-specific)
    if source_folder and source_folder != 'INBOX':
        try:
            # Use IMAP STORE command to remove specific label
            for uid in message_uids:
                mailbox.client.uid('STORE', uid, '-X-GM-LABELS', f'"{source_folder}"')
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Could not remove source label {source_folder}: {e}")
```

#### 3. Modified Processing Functions

**Enhanced `process_inbox()` for Gmail:**
```python
def process_inbox(account, folder="INBOX", limit=100):
    # ... existing logic ...
    
    if is_gmail_account(account.email):
        # Gmail-specific processing
        gmail_aware_move(mb, whitelisted, processed_folder, 'INBOX')
        gmail_aware_move(mb, blacklisted, junk_folder, 'INBOX') 
        gmail_aware_move(mb, vendorlist, approved_ads_folder, 'INBOX')
        gmail_aware_move(mb, pending, pending_folder, 'INBOX')
    else:
        # Standard IMAP processing
        mb.move(whitelisted, processed_folder)
        mb.move(blacklisted, junk_folder)
        mb.move(vendorlist, approved_ads_folder)
        mb.move(pending, pending_folder)
```

**Enhanced Training Folder Processing:**
```python
def process_folder(list_file, account, start_folder, dest_folder):
    # ... existing logic ...
    
    if is_gmail_account(account.email):
        # Remove training label after processing
        gmail_aware_move(mb, msgs_to_move, dest_folder, start_folder)
    else:
        mb.move(msgs_to_move, dest_folder)
```

#### 4. Gmail Configuration Options

Add Gmail-specific settings to account configuration:
```python
class GmailSettings:
    """Gmail-specific processing settings"""
    cleanup_training_labels: bool = True
    cleanup_pending_labels: bool = True
    preserve_inbox_label: bool = False  # Keep messages in Inbox view
    custom_label_prefix: str = "MailRulez/"  # Prefix for custom labels
```

#### 5. Label Management API

```python
class GmailLabelManager:
    """Manage Gmail labels for email processing"""
    
    def remove_label(self, mailbox, message_uids, label_name):
        """Remove specific label from messages"""
        
    def list_message_labels(self, mailbox, message_uid):
        """Get all labels for a specific message"""
        
    def cleanup_processing_labels(self, mailbox, message_uids):
        """Remove temporary processing labels (Pending, training folders)"""
        
    def apply_retention_with_labels(self, mailbox, folder, age, preserve_labels=None):
        """Apply retention while preserving specified labels"""
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Label Cleanup**: Verify training labels are removed after processing
2. **Pending Label Removal**: Confirm Pending labels are cleaned up
3. **Multi-Label Messages**: Test messages with multiple labels
4. **Performance Impact**: Measure impact of additional IMAP operations
5. **Error Handling**: Test label removal failures and fallbacks

### Test Environment
- Gmail account with test messages
- Various label combinations
- Large message volumes for performance testing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **IMAP Performance**: Additional label operations may slow processing
- **Gmail API Limits**: Potential rate limiting on label operations
- **imap-tools Compatibility**: Library may not support advanced label operations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Batch label operations where possible
- Implement retry logic for rate limiting
- Fallback to standard move operations if label removal fails
- Add configuration to disable Gmail-specific processing if needed

## Success Criteria

1. **Clean Workflows**: Messages appear in only their intended "folder" after processing
2. **No Reprocessing**: Processed messages don't get reprocessed due to label confusion
3. **User Experience**: Gmail users see expected folder-like behavior
4. **Performance**: Processing time impact < 20% for Gmail accounts
5. **Reliability**: System gracefully handles Gmail-specific errors

## Future Considerations

### Gmail-Specific Features
- **Conversation Threading**: Handle Gmail's conversation grouping
- **Important Markers**: Respect Gmail's importance indicators
- **Categories**: Integration with Gmail's automatic categorization
- **Search Integration**: Leverage Gmail's powerful search for rule conditions

### Alternative Approaches
- **Gmail API Integration**: Consider using Gmail API instead of IMAP for better label control
- **Hybrid Approach**: IMAP for reading, Gmail API for label management
- **User Configuration**: Let users choose between folder-style vs label-style behavior

## Related Issues

- **Defect #3**: Gmail Conversations Going Straight to Processed (may be resolved by this feature)
- **Defect #4**: Items Going to Approved Ads When Senders Not in Vendors [GMAIL ONLY] (label confusion)

---

*This feature addresses the fundamental architectural mismatch between folder-based email processing and Gmail's label-based system, ensuring clean and predictable email workflows for Gmail users.*

# Processed Folder Cleanup Feature

## Problem Statement

When the system transitions from **Startup Mode** to **Maintenance Mode**, the **Processed folder becomes redundant and unnecessary**. This creates several issues:

### Current Behavior Analysis

**Startup Mode:**
- Whitelisted emails → **Processed folder** (auto-processed)
- Blacklisted emails → Junk folder
- Vendor emails → Approved Ads folder  
- Unknown emails → Pending folder

**Maintenance Mode:**
- Whitelisted emails → **Stay in Inbox** (user handles manually)
- Blacklisted emails → Junk folder
- Vendor emails → Approved Ads folder
- Unknown emails → Pending folder

### Issues with Current Approach

1. **Folder Confusion**: Users see a Processed folder that will never receive new messages
2. **Storage Waste**: Processed folder may contain thousands of old emails taking up space
3. **IMAP Clutter**: Unnecessary folder structure in user's email client
4. **Gmail Labels**: For Gmail users, the "Processed" label continues to exist unused
5. **User Uncertainty**: Users don't understand why the folder exists but is empty

## Proposed Solution: Processed Folder Cleanup UX Flow

### Feature: Startup-to-Maintenance Transition Assistant

When transitioning from Startup to Maintenance mode, present user with **Processed Folder Cleanup Options**.

#### UX Flow Design

**Step 1: Transition Detection**
- System detects when switching from Startup → Maintenance mode
- Trigger cleanup dialog/wizard before completing transition

**Step 2: Processed Folder Analysis**
```
Processed Folder Status:
├── Message Count: 2,847 messages
├── Date Range: Jan 15, 2024 - Jun 16, 2025
├── Storage Size: ~145 MB
└── Folder Type: IMAP folder / Gmail label
```

**Step 3: User Choice Dialog**

```

│  [ Cancel ]  [ Continue with Selected Option ]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Implementation Options

**Option 1: Keep Processed Folder (Default/Recommended)**
- Mark folder as "read-only" in system configuration
- Add UI indicator that folder is archived/inactive
- Display message: "Contains messages from Startup Mode (Jan-Jun 2025)"

**Option 2: Delete Processed Folder**
- Verify folder is not empty → Show warning
- For Gmail: Remove "Processed" label from all messages
- For IMAP: Delete folder after moving/deleting messages
- Confirmation step with final warning

**Option 3: Archive Messages**
- Move all Processed messages to user-specified folder
- Delete empty Processed folder
- Update system configuration to reflect new archive location

**Option 4: Export and Delete**
- Generate downloadable archive (mbox/eml format)
- Provide download link with expiration
- Delete Processed folder after successful download

#### Advanced UX Features

**Smart Recommendations:**
```python
def recommend_cleanup_option(processed_count, account_type, storage_usage):
    if processed_count > 5000:
        return "archive"  # Too many to delete safely
    elif account_type == "gmail" and storage_usage > 80:
        return "delete"   # Gmail storage pressure
    elif processed_count < 100:
        return "keep"     # Small enough to keep
    else:
        return "archive"  # Default safe option
```

**Folder Analysis Preview:**
- Show date range of messages
- Display top senders in Processed folder
- Storage impact calculation
- Estimated time for cleanup operation

#### Gmail-Specific Considerations

**Gmail Label Cleanup:**
- Remove "Processed" label from all messages
- Messages return to Inbox or other labels they have
- Use `gmail_aware_move()` function for clean removal
- Handle conversation threading properly

# Docker Deployment Reliability & System Agnostic Feature

## Problem Statement

Current Docker deployment has **critical reliability issues** that prevent it from being truly system-agnostic and deployable. The deployment requires manual intervention, has environment variable loading failures, permission issues, and complex configuration that defeats the goal of a self-hosted container image.

### Current Deployment Issues

**Environment Variable Problems:**
- `.env` file not loaded when Docker Compose run with `sudo`
- Requires manual `export` of variables for deployment to work
- MASTER_KEY and FLASK_SECRET_KEY warnings even with proper `.env` file
- Non-portable between different user environments

**Permission & Mount Issues:**
- Config directory bind mount causing validation failures
- Container expects writable `/app/config` but mount is read-only
- Host directory permissions vary across systems
- Validation strictness causing restart loops

**User Experience Problems:**
- Deployment requires Docker expertise to troubleshoot
- Not "one-click" deployable as intended
- Manual intervention needed on every system
- Complex multi-file configuration (docker-compose + .env + permissions)

**Docker Compose Compatibility:**
- Multiple warnings about unsupported options
- Version compatibility issues across Docker installations
- Overly complex configuration for basic email processing

### Impact on Self-Hosted Goal

This **breaks the fundamental promise** of a system-agnostic, self-hosted application:
- Users can't simply `git clone` and `docker-compose up`
- Requires system administration knowledge
- Different behavior on different systems
- Deployment failure rate high for typical users

## Proposed Solution: Deployment Reliability Overhaul

### Feature: Self-Contained Docker Deployment

Create a truly reliable, system-agnostic deployment that works on **any Docker-capable system** without manual intervention.

#### Core Principles

1. **Zero Manual Configuration**: Container starts successfully with sane defaults
2. **Self-Generating Security**: Secure keys generated at runtime if not provided
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing configuration doesn't prevent startup
4. **Volume Simplification**: Minimize bind mounts and permission dependencies
5. **One-Command Deployment**: `docker run` or `docker-compose up` works immediately

#### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Environment Variable Self-Sufficiency**
```python
# In container startup script
def ensure_secure_environment():
    """Generate secure defaults if environment variables missing"""
    
    # Generate MASTER_KEY if not provided
    if not os.getenv('MASTER_KEY'):
        master_key = base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode()
        os.environ['MASTER_KEY'] = master_key
        logging.info("Generated MASTER_KEY at runtime")
    
    # Generate FLASK_SECRET_KEY if not provided  
    if not os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY'):
        flask_key = os.urandom(32).hex()
        os.environ['FLASK_SECRET_KEY'] = flask_key
        logging.info("Generated FLASK_SECRET_KEY at runtime")
    
    # Store generated keys persistently
    save_generated_keys_to_volume()
```

**Phase 2: Volume Mount Simplification**
```yaml
# Simplified docker-compose with minimal bind mounts
volumes:
  # Use named volumes for everything except truly optional overrides
  - mail_rulez_data:/app/data
  - mail_rulez_lists:/app/lists  
  - mail_rulez_logs:/app/logs
  - mail_rulez_config:/app/config  # Named volume, not bind mount
  
  # Optional configuration override (advanced users only)
  # - ./custom-config:/app/config-override:ro
```

**Phase 3: Validation & Startup Improvements**
```python
# Graceful startup validation
def validate_environment_graceful():
    """Validate environment but allow startup with warnings"""
    
    issues = []
    
    # Check directory permissions (warn but continue)
    for directory in ['/app/data', '/app/logs', '/app/lists']:
        if not os.access(directory, os.W_OK):
            issues.append(f"Limited permissions on {directory}")
    
    # Check configuration completeness (warn but continue)
    if not os.path.exists('/app/config/accounts.json'):
        issues.append("No accounts configured - use web interface")
    
    if issues:
        logging.warning(f"Startup issues detected: {issues}")
        logging.info("Container will start with limited functionality")
        logging.info("Use web interface at http://localhost:5001 to configure")
    
    # Only fail for truly critical issues
    return len(critical_issues) == 0
```

#### Technical Implementation

**Enhanced Container Initialization:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /entrypoint.sh - Enhanced startup script

echo "[INFO] === Mail-Rulez Self-Contained Startup ==="

# Step 1: Generate secure environment if needed
python3 /app/scripts/generate_environment.py

# Step 2: Initialize configuration directories
python3 /app/scripts/init_directories.py

# Step 3: Graceful validation (warn but continue)
python3 /app/scripts/validate_graceful.py

# Step 4: Start application
echo "[INFO] Starting Mail-Rulez web interface..."
exec "$@"
```

**Simplified Docker Compose:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.simple.yml - Minimal reliable configuration
version: '3.8'

services:
  mail-rulez:
    build: .
    container_name: mail-rulez
    restart: unless-stopped
    
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
    
    # Named volumes only - no bind mount issues
    volumes:
      - mail_rulez_data:/app/data
      - mail_rulez_lists:/app/lists
      - mail_rulez_logs:/app/logs
      - mail_rulez_config:/app/config
    
    # Optional environment (all have secure defaults)
    environment:
      - PORT=${PORT:-5001}
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
      - MAIL_RULEZ_STRICT_VALIDATION=false  # Graceful startup
    
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5001/auth/session/status"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s

volumes:
  mail_rulez_data:
  mail_rulez_lists:
  mail_rulez_logs:
  mail_rulez_config:
```

**One-Command Docker Run:**
```bash
# Single command deployment option
docker run -d \
  --name mail-rulez \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 5001:5001 \
  -v mail_rulez_data:/app/data \
  -v mail_rulez_lists:/app/lists \
  -v mail_rulez_logs:/app/logs \
  -v mail_rulez_config:/app/config \
  mail-rulez:latest
```

#### Advanced Features

**Persistent Key Management:**
```python
# Store generated keys in volume for container restarts
def persist_generated_keys():
    """Save runtime-generated keys to persistent storage"""
    
    key_file = '/app/config/generated-keys.json'
    
    keys = {
        'master_key': os.getenv('MASTER_KEY'),
        'flask_secret_key': os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY'),
        'generated_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    # Encrypt and store
    with open(key_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(encrypt_sensitive_data(keys), f)
```

**Configuration Migration:**
```python
# Help users migrate from complex to simple deployment
def migrate_from_complex_deployment():
    """Detect and migrate complex deployment configurations"""
    
    if os.path.exists('/app/config-override'):
        logging.info("Migrating from bind mount configuration...")
        copy_configuration('/app/config-override', '/app/config')
        
    if os.path.exists('/.env'):
        logging.info("Importing environment from .env file...")
        load_env_file_to_persistent_config('/.env')
```

**Self-Diagnostic Tools:**
```python
# Built-in diagnostics accessible via web interface
def system_diagnostics():
    """Comprehensive system health check"""
    
    return {
        'container_status': 'healthy',
        'environment_status': check_environment_completeness(),
        'volume_status': check_volume_accessibility(),
        'network_status': check_network_connectivity(),

        'recommendations': generate_improvement_recommendations()
    }
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Self-Contained Environment ⭐ CRITICAL PRIORITY
- [ ] Create `generate_environment.py` script for runtime key generation
- [ ] Modify entrypoint.sh to handle missing environment variables gracefully
- [ ] Add persistent key storage in config volume
- [ ] Test deployment without .env file

### Phase 2: Volume Simplification
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.simple.yml` with named volumes only
- [ ] Remove problematic bind mounts
- [ ] Add optional configuration override mechanism
- [ ] Test cross-platform volume behavior

### Phase 3: Graceful Validation & Startup
- [ ] Replace strict validation with graceful warnings
- [ ] Implement progressive startup (basic → full functionality)
- [ ] Add web-based configuration for post-startup setup
- [ ] Create self-diagnostic tools

### Phase 4: One-Command Deployment
- [ ] Create simple `docker run` command documentation
- [ ] Add deployment validation script
- [ ] Create automated deployment testing
- [ ] Document migration from complex to simple deployment

### Phase 5: Documentation & User Experience
- [ ] Create "Quick Start" documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Create deployment testing on multiple platforms
- [ ] User acceptance testing with non-technical users

## Technical Requirements

### Container Modifications Needed
```python
# New files to create:
/app/scripts/generate_environment.py     # Runtime environment generation
/app/scripts/init_directories.py        # Directory initialization
/app/scripts/validate_graceful.py       # Non-blocking validation
/app/scripts/migrate_config.py          # Configuration migration
/app/web/routes/diagnostics.py          # Self-diagnostic web interface
```

### Docker Configuration Changes
```yaml
# New files to create:
docker/docker-compose.simple.yml        # Simplified deployment
docker/Dockerfile.simple               # Minimal production build
docker/deploy-simple.sh                # One-command deployment script
```

### Web Interface Enhancements
- Configuration wizard for first-time setup
- System diagnostics page
- Environment variable management
- Migration assistance tools

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero-Configuration Startup**: Container starts successfully with `docker run` and no environment variables
2. **Cross-Platform Reliability**: Same deployment works on Linux, macOS, Windows without modification
3. **Security by Default**: Automatically generates secure keys if none provided
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality available immediately, advanced features configurable
5. **User-Friendly**: Non-technical users can deploy without Docker expertise
6. **Migration Path**: Existing complex deployments can migrate to simple deployment

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Key Generation**: Runtime key generation must be cryptographically secure
- **Volume Compatibility**: Named volumes must work across all Docker environments
- **Configuration Loss**: Risk of losing configuration during migration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use proven cryptographic libraries for key generation
- Extensive cross-platform testing of volume behavior
- Configuration backup and restore mechanisms
- Comprehensive migration documentation
